# Make

Make allows middle- and high-school age children to design, develop, test, play, and share their own 2-D physics-enabled games directly on their iPad without any programming knowledge.

This project is in its preliminary stages, and I encourage interested parties to watch/star the repo for updates. If you'd like to be added as a beta tester through Apple TestFlight and receive updated binaries directly to your iPad, email me at [rbstarbuck@gmail.com](mailto:rbstarbuck@gmail.com).

## Build instructions

Requirements: Xcode 8+, iPad or Simulator with iOS 9.0+.

Because this project uses Cocoapods, you must open **``Make.xcworkspace``** in Xcode (*not* ``Make.xcodeproj``). All dependencies are included--you won't need to download Cocoapods or any APIs.
